Spam Mail Prediction System

Overview

This project is a machine learning-based spam mail prediction system. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify email messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The model is trained using logistic regression and utilizes TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.
